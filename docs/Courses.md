# Courses

Here we curate a collection of skill-building courses that we can recommend.

## Data Analysis with Python, R, or SQL

One of the first major decisions to make when getting into data analysis is about which language to choose. This [infographic](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis) by Datacamp provides an helpful overview about R and Python and might be a good starting point to inform yourself. 

In terms of courses, we also recommend the courses by [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), as they offer [free class accounts](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education) that can be applied for by academic instructors.

We also have made good experiences with [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/), especially for other programming languages and use cases beyond data analysis, however, their classroom programme is limited to the USA at the time of writing (February 2021).
