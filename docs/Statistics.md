# Statistics

One of the first major decisions to make when getting into data analysis is about which language to choose. Python and R are the widely used programming languages in the field of statistics and data science and both are great choices. Below you will find some condensed information about their application for statistics. However, you also might want to have a look at this [infographic](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis) by Datacamp, as it provides some helpful general guidance about both languages and might be a good starting point to inform yourself. 


# R for statistics

R was initially used mostly in academia. R is great for exploratory data analysis. Among all the community R is popular among Statisticians, engineers, and scientists without computer programming skills. All kind of statistical tests and models can easily be used in R. its easier to learn R as beginners, so as users who are already experienced finds R easy.

### Usability:

- People without coding experience finds R easier than another programming.
- Statistical model can be build using very few lines of code.
- Same piece of function can be written in several ways 

### Ecosystems:

- Allows the user to strings their workflow which is good for data analysis
- Packages are a collection of R functions and compiled code. 
- Packages are available at [CRAN](-https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) , [Bioconductor](-https://www.bioconductor.org/) packages for   bioinformatics and in Github

### Advantages:

- Very popular for visualization 
- Good amounts of functionalities for data science 
- Great for statistical models and tests

### Disadvantages:

- People from no technical background finds it as little bit difficult as R is developed by statisticians 
- Can be considered slow code and poorly written
- Not very popular for deep learning and NLP

### Popular libraries:

- Dplyr, tidyr and data.table to manipulate data
- Stringr to manipulate string 
- Zoo to work with time series 
- Caret for machine learning  
- ggplot2 for visualization  

### IDE

RStudio is the most popular IDE among the R users

# Python + pandas

Python is used by programmers who dealt with data analysis, statistical techniques, or by developers. Python can be used as a single tool that can be integrated with every part of your workflow. Python is really flexible for beginners to build anything that was never built before.
### Usability:

- Coding debugging easy due to simple syntax
- People who come from a computer science background may find python more naturally than R
- Indentation easily reflects by the code meaning 

### Ecosystem:

- Python code is clear and easy to interpret
- Good with data science, machine learning which is also integrated with web frameworks
- Python package index PyPi and anaconda are repositories of python software with all libraries.
Where user can also contribute 

### Advantages: 

- General-purpose programming language which can be used strongly in data analysis
- Popular among the users for its code readability
- Great for math and statistical computation 

### Disadvantages:

- Doesnâ€™t have as many libraries dedicated to data science as R
- Requires testing as error can show up in runtime
- Visualization results are not as eye-pleasing compare to R

### Popular libraries:

- Pandas specialized to handle data
- SciPy and NumPy used for computational scientific purpose 
- Scikit-learn dedicated to machine learning
- Matplotlib and seaborn to make graphics 
- Statsmodels to explore statistical models and perform statistical tests and unit test

### IDE

More popular IDE for python is jupyter notebooks, spyder, vs code
