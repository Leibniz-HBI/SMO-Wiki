# R for statistics

R is a freely distributed software package for statistical analysis and graphics, developed and managed by the R Development Core Team. R can be downloaded from the Internet site of the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) (http://cran.r-project.org). Check that you download the correct version of R for your operating system (for example, XP for the PC, Tiger or earlier versions of OSX for Macs). R is related to the S statistical language which is commercially available as S-PLUS.

R has advantages over other (commercially available) statistical packages. Because it is an open source package, it is updated on an ongoing basis. Thus, there is no need to wait for the next ‘‘big release’’ for R to incorporate important improvements. The latest and most novel statistical approaches and refinements are incorporated much faster than is the case with other more traditional commercially available packages.It is important to note that some graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are currently available (e.g., the Rcmdr function), which allow users a more familiar point-and-click interface found in programs such as SPSS. However, the current R GUIs are not as refined as commercial software. As noted in ‘‘Rcmdr’’ is a GUI that allows users to employ a variety of statistical methods; in addition, a statistical teaching plug-in tool (‘‘RcmdrPlugin. TeachingDemos’’) is available to use with ‘‘Rcmdr’’ to demonstrate the logic of the central limit theorem, correlation, and confidence intervals.

# Python + pandas

Pandas is an open source Python package that provides numerous tools for data analysis. The package comes with several data structures that can be used for many different data manipulation tasks. It also has a variety of methods that can be invoked for data analysis, which comes in handy when working on data science and machine learning problems in Python.

* Installing Pandas
The standard Python distribution does not come with the Pandas module. To use this 3rd party module, you must install it.
The nice thing about Python is that it comes bundled with a tool called pip that can be used for the installation of Pandas. The do the installation, you need to run the following command:

```
pip install pandas

```

# [Stata](https://www.stata.com/)

Stata is a general-purpose statistical software package created in 1985 by StataCorp. Most of its users work in research, especially in the fields of economics, sociology, political science, biomedicine, and epidemiology.Stata's capabilities include data management, statistical analysis, graphics, simulations, regression, and custom programming. It also has a system to disseminate user-written programs that lets it grow continuously.


* PROS

- User friendly and easy to learn	
- python integration
- Version control	
- Many free online resources for learning	

* CONS

- An individual license can cost between $125 and $425 annually
- Limited to certain types of data

#### Applications

* stata offers the easy to use graphical user interface. It is quite simple to use because it uses the point and clicks GUI. The best part 
  of its user interface is can adapt to the different type of users i.e. newbies and the experienced one. No one will ever face any problem 
  while using Stata. 

* Stat’s GUI offers menus and dialog boxes. With the help of these dialog boxes, users can access plenty of useful features i.e., data 
  management, data analysis, and statistical analysis. You can have easy access to the data, graphics, and statistical menu. 

* Stata is a developer and programmer-friendly because it offers the command line feature. Its command line has a set of features that 
  allows programmers to type the command and run them. The programmers can type the command scripts and syntax and then run the commands. 
  The solutions of the command will respond and show the results in the result windows. 

* Stata also offers a set of advanced components that allows you to work more efficiently. You can use a data editor that will help you to 
  see that live data while using the functions and perform operations. 

* It also offers the data management capabilities that allow you to have full control over data sets. You can link the data set together 
  and reshape them quickly with the help of Stata. Apart from that, you can also define, edit, and manage variables in Stata.

* You can also create graphs in stat more effectively. Stata allows you to create graphs in both of the ways; the first one is merely 
  pointing and clicking, and the second one with the help of the command line. In the command line, you need to write the script that 
  continuously comes up with a large number of graphs. You can use these graphs in printing, publications, and export. It supports multiple 
  file formats such as EPS, TIF, PNG, and SVG. You can also edit the graph in Stata using the integrated graph editor in Stata.
