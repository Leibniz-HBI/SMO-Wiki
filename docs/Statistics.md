# Statistics

# R for statistics

R is a programming language that is widely used all over the world. It is mostly popular for its open-source resources. The source code of 
R can be found in the GNU General Public license so that its user can copy, modify, or redistributed the software as long as the source code is made available.[1][2] 

### The basics features of R

- Open source 
- Many statistical packages with graphics capabilities 
- Various machine learning operation libraries 
- Sophisticated graphics using ggplot2

### Packages of R

- Base package contains all fundamental functions including utils, stats, datasets, graphics,
  grDevices, grid, methods, toolsm parallel, compiler, splines, etc.

- More recommender package would be boot, class, cluster, code tools, foreign, lattice, mgcd, 
  Matrix, nnet, MASS, spatial, survival, rpart, etc

### Limitation of R

- Objects store in physical memory
- Less speed 
- Bad way to handle data

# Python + pandas

Pandas is a python library that contains high-level data structure and manipulation tools to analyze data in python easily. Build on the top of the Numpy, pandas have the advantage to use all Numpy supported applications.[3]

Advantages of pandas:

- Labeled axes supported data structure 
- Time series functionality 
- Merge or other common operation which is popular in other databases like SQL
- Arithmetic operation in metadata
- Easy to handle missing  data

* Installing Pandas

The standard Python distribution does not come with the Pandas module. To use this 3rd party module, you must install it.
The nice thing about Python is that it comes bundled with a tool called pip that can be used for the installation of Pandas. The do the installation, you need to run the following command:

```
pip install pandas

```
